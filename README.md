# Morra Game Against AI

The Morra game is a hand-gesture guessing game where two players simultaneously reveal a certain number of fingers, and the one who correctly predicts the total sum wins.

It is User vs. AI. The AI employs different strategies depending on the difficulty level. I implemented this using various object-oriented design patterns.
